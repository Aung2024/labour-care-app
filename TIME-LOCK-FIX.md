# Time Locking Feature Implementation

## 🎯 Purpose
Prevent midwives from accidentally changing labour times after they've been set, protecting against data loss from overwritten records.

## 🔒 Changes Made

### 1. Time Input Locking (labour-care-setup.html)

**New `confirmTime()` function behavior:**
- When midwife clicks "OK" on a time input
- Input is immediately disabled (locked)
- Display shows "Locked: [time]" in red
- OK button is hidden
- Input field turns gray (#f3f4f6 background)

**Locking triggers:**
- ✅ When midwife manually enters time and clicks "OK"
- ✅ When time is loaded from existing Classic LCG data
- ✅ When page loads with existing Carousel LCG data

**Visual Indicators:**
```
Before: [07:00] [OK button]
After:  [07:00 (gray, disabled)] "Locked: 7:00 AM" (red)
```

### 2. Debug Logging (labour-care-entry.html)

Added comprehensive logging to track second stage time loading:
```javascript
console.log('🔍 Time loading debug:');
console.log('  First Stage:', state.startTime);
console.log('  Second Stage:', state.secondStageTime);
console.log('  Summary data:', data);
console.log('  StartingTimeDoc:', startingTimeDoc.data());
console.log('  SecondStageDoc:', secondStageDoc.data());
```

This helps identify why second stage time might not be loading.

### 3. Validation in startLabourCare()

Added checks to log when locked times are being used:
```javascript
if (firstStageStartInput.disabled) {
  console.log('🔒 First stage time is locked, proceeding with existing data');
}
```

## 🔄 Workflow

### Scenario 1: New Entry (Fresh Start)
1. Midwife enters Active First Stage time
2. Clicks "OK" → Time is locked
3. Midwife enters Second Stage time (optional)
4. Clicks "OK" → Time is locked
5. Clicks "Record Labour Care Grid" → Proceeds to entry page

### Scenario 2: Existing Entry (Data from Classic LCG)
1. Page loads with existing times
2. Times are automatically locked on page load
3. Midwife cannot modify times
4. Can proceed to entry page immediately

### Scenario 3: Revisiting Setup Page
1. Midwife revisits setup page
2. Times from previous entry are loaded
3. Times are automatically locked
4. Midwife cannot accidentally change times
5. Data integrity is maintained

## 🛡️ Data Protection

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents accidental time changes
- ✅ Protects existing labour records
- ✅ Prevents data overwrites
- ✅ Clear visual feedback (locked state)
- ✅ Consistent behavior across modes

**Locking Applies To:**
- Active First Stage Start Time
- Second Stage Start Time

**Can Still Modify:**
- Labour Onset (dropdown)
- Active Labour Diagnosis
- Ruptured Membrane time
- Risk Factors

## 🔍 Debugging Second Stage Time

If second stage time is not loading properly, check console logs:

```javascript
🔍 Time loading debug:
  First Stage: 07:00
  Second Stage: null  // ← PROBLEM: Should have a time
  Summary data: { startingTime: '07:00', secondStageTime: null }
  StartingTimeDoc: { startingTime: '07:00' }
  SecondStageDoc: none  // ← PROBLEM: Document might not exist
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Second stage time was never set
2. Document path mismatch
3. Field name mismatch
4. Firestore query issue

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Enter new times, click OK → verify locking
- [ ] Load existing data → verify auto-locking
- [ ] Try to edit locked time → should be disabled
- [ ] Check console for debug logs
- [ ] Verify second stage time loads properly
- [ ] Test with data from Classic LCG
- [ ] Test with data from Carousel LCG
- [ ] Revisit setup page → verify locks persist

## 🚀 Status
Time locking implemented! Midwives can no longer accidentally change times after they're set.
