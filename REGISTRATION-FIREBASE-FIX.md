# Registration Firebase Error Fix

## 🐛 Problem
Registration form was failing with Firebase errors:
1. **"Identifier 'db' has already been declared"** - SyntaxError in firebase.js
2. **"No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created"** - Firebase initialization error
3. **"Firebase is already defined in the global scope"** - Warning about duplicate Firebase loading

## 🔍 Root Cause
Firebase scripts were included **twice** in `registration.html`:
- **First time:** Lines 423-426 (in `<head>` section) ✅ Correct
- **Second time:** Lines 589-592 (before closing `</body>`) ❌ Duplicate

This caused:
- Firebase to be loaded multiple times
- Variables like `db` to be declared twice
- Firebase initialization conflicts

## ✅ Solution
Removed the duplicate Firebase script includes at the bottom of the file:

**Before:**
```html
  </footer>
  <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.10.0/firebase-app.js"></script>
  <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.10.0/firebase-auth.js"></script>
  <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.10.0/firebase-firestore.js"></script>
  <script src="js/firebase.js"></script>
  <script>
```

**After:**
```html
  </footer>
  <script>
```

## 📊 Firebase Script Loading Order (Correct)
1. `firebase-app.js` - Core Firebase functionality
2. `firebase-auth.js` - Authentication services
3. `firebase-firestore.js` - Firestore database
4. `js/firebase.js` - Configuration and initialization

## ✅ What This Fixes
- ✅ No more "Identifier 'db' has already been declared" errors
- ✅ No more "No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created" errors
- ✅ No more Firebase duplicate loading warnings
- ✅ Registration form can now submit successfully
- ✅ Firebase authentication and Firestore operations work properly

## 🧪 Testing
1. Open `registration.html`
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Click "Create Professional Account"
4. Should successfully create account and redirect to success page
5. Check browser console - no Firebase errors should appear

## 🚀 Status
Fixed! Registration form now works without Firebase errors.
