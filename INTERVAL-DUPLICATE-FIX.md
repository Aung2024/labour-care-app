# Labour Care Entry - 1-Hour Interval Duplicate Issue Fix

## 🐛 Problem
The timepoints like 01:23, 02:23, 03:23 are on the hour AND at 30-minute intervals. The deduplication logic was preventing 60-min interval timepoints from being added because they already existed as 30-min intervals.

**Issue:** A timepoint can represent multiple intervals!
- 01:23 can be BOTH a 30-min interval (for FHR/Contractions) AND a 60-min interval (for Support, Woman, Baby, etc.)

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Removed Deduplication Logic
Changed from:
```javascript
const alreadyExists = result.some(tp => tp.time === timeStr);
if (!alreadyExists) { ... }
```

To:
```javascript
// Always add 1-hour intervals regardless of duplicates
result.push({ time: timeStr, interval: '60min' });
```

This allows the same time to exist with multiple interval types.

### 2. Updated `getIntervalForTimepoint()` 
Now finds ALL timepoints with the same time and checks if any have 60-min interval:

```javascript
const tps = state.timepoints.filter(t => t.time === timepoint);
const has60min = tps.some(tp => tp.interval === '60min');
if (has60min) {
  return '60min'; // Show all fields
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added debug logs to show:
- How many 1-hour timepoints were generated
- The interval type for each timepoint
- Clear indication when selecting a 60-min timepoint

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Timepoint Structure
A timepoint can now have multiple entries:
```javascript
// 01:23 exists as BOTH:
{ time: '01:23', interval: '30min' }  // For FHR/Contractions
{ time: '01:23', interval: '60min' }  // For Support/Woman/Baby/etc.
```

### Section Display Logic
When selecting a timepoint:
1. Check if it has a 60-min interval
2. If YES → Show ALL sections (Support, FHR, Woman, Baby, Contractions, Cervix, Descent, Meds, SDM)
3. If NO → Show only FHR and Contractions

### Example Times
- **01:23** → Both 30min + 60min = Show ALL sections ✅
- **01:53** → Only 30min = Show FHR + Contractions only
- **02:23** → Both 30min + 60min = Show ALL sections ✅
- **07:30** → 15min (second stage) = Show FHR + Contractions + Cervix

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Midwives can now enter ALL data at appropriate times
2. **No Missing Data**: Support, Woman, Baby sections now accessible
3. **Smart Filtering**: Right fields at the right time
4. **Clear UX**: Easy to see which sections are available

## 🚀 Status
Fixed! 1-hour intervals now generate properly and display all sections.
