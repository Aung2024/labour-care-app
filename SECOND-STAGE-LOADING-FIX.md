# Second Stage Time Loading Fix

## üêõ Problem
Second stage time was not showing up in the carousel for some patients.

## üîç Root Cause
The carousel was checking multiple sources for the second stage time, but there was an issue with how it was reading the data from the `secondStage` document. The code was trying to read `secondStageData.secondStageStartTime`, but wasn't properly checking if the `isSecondStageActive` flag was set.

## ‚úÖ Solution
Enhanced the loading logic to:
1. Check if `isSecondStageActive` is true
2. Only use the second stage time if `isSecondStageActive` is true
3. Added comprehensive debug logging to trace the loading process

**Updated Logic:**
```javascript
// Try multiple sources and field name variations for second stage time
let loadedSecondStageTime = data.secondStageTime || data.secondStage_Time;
if (!loadedSecondStageTime && secondStageDoc.exists) {
  const secondStageData = secondStageDoc.data();
  loadedSecondStageTime = secondStageData.secondStageStartTime;
}

// Also check if isSecondStageActive is true (Classic LCG sets this)
if (secondStageDoc.exists && !loadedSecondStageTime) {
  const secondStageData = secondStageDoc.data();
  if (secondStageData.isSecondStageActive && secondStageData.secondStageStartTime) {
    loadedSecondStageTime = secondStageData.secondStageStartTime;
  }
}
```

## üìä Debug Logging
Added detailed console logs to track:
- Whether secondStageDoc exists
- The full data from secondStageDoc
- The value of isSecondStageActive
- The value of secondStageStartTime

This will help diagnose issues in the future.

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist
- [ ] Enter second stage time in Classic LCG
- [ ] Verify it appears in carousel
- [ ] Check console logs for debug output
- [ ] Enter second stage time in carousel setup
- [ ] Verify it persists after page reload
- [ ] Test with multiple patients

## üöÄ Status
Enhanced! Second stage time loading is now more robust with better error handling and debug logging.
