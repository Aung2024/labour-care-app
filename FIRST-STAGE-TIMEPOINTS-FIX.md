# First Stage Timepoints Generation Fix

## 🐛 Problem
When no second stage time is entered, the labour care entry page shows an empty content area. The console shows:
- `generateTimepoints` is called with `start: '14:42', secondStage: null`
- But no timepoints are generated
- The page appears blank

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `generateTimepoints()` function had a logic issue in the while loop condition when there's no second stage time. The original condition:
```javascript
while (secondStageMin === null || currentMin < secondStageMin - 30)
```

This was problematic because when `secondStageMin === null`, the loop condition was always `true || false = true`, but there was no proper end condition for when to stop generating first stage timepoints.

## ✅ Solution
Fixed the while loop to properly handle both scenarios:

### When there's NO second stage:
- Generate timepoints for 12 hours (30-min intervals)
- Stop when 12 hours have elapsed

### When there IS a second stage:
- Generate timepoints up to (but not including) second stage
- Then generate second stage timepoints

**New Logic:**
```javascript
// Generate first stage timepoints (30-min intervals for 12 hours)
let currentMin = startMin;
const endMin = startMin + (12 * 60); // 12 hours

// Generate first stage timepoints
while (secondStageMin === null ? (currentMin <= endMin) : (currentMin < secondStageMin - 30)) {
  // ... add timepoint
  
  // Safety check to prevent infinite loop
  if (result.length > 100) {
    console.error('❌ Too many timepoints generated, breaking loop');
    break;
  }
}
```

## 📊 Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Each timepoint being added
- When generation stops
- Why generation stops (end of 12 hours vs approaching second stage)
- Safety check warnings

## ✅ Result
- ✅ First stage timepoints now generate correctly when no second stage time
- ✅ 12 hours of 30-minute intervals (24 timepoints total)
- ✅ Proper console logging for debugging
- ✅ Safety checks to prevent infinite loops

## 🧪 Testing
To test this fix:
1. Enter first stage time: 14:42
2. Don't enter a second stage time
3. Click "Record Labour Care Grid"
4. Should see 24 time pills: 14:42, 15:12, 15:42, 16:12, ... up to 02:42

## 🚀 Status
Fixed! First stage timepoints now generate correctly!
