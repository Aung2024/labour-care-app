# Labour Care Button Fix - Final Update

## 🐛 Problem
The purple button was still showing "View Labour Record" instead of "LCG Table View" because legacy JavaScript code was overriding the HTML button text.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The JavaScript had old code that was looking for a single button (`.care-card.labour .care-action`) and updating its innerHTML to "View Labour Record", "Continue Labour Care", or "View Labour Data" based on patient status. This was from the old design when there was only one button for Labour Care.

## ✅ Solution
Removed the legacy JavaScript code that was overriding the button text. The buttons now correctly display:

### HTML Structure (Lines 670-676)
- **LCG Table View** (purple button) - links to Classic LCG (summary.html)
- **LCG Carousel View** (blue button) - links to Carousel LCG (labour-care-setup.html)

### Colors
- **LCG Table View**: Purple gradient (#7c3aed → #6d28d9)
- **LCG Carousel View**: Blue gradient (#3b82f6 → #2563eb)

### Navigation Functions
- `navigateToLabourClassic()` - goes to summary.html
- `navigateToLabourCarousel()` - goes to labour-care-setup.html

## 🚀 Status
Fixed! The buttons now display the correct text and colors permanently without being overridden by JavaScript.
