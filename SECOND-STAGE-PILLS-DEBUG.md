# Labour Care Entry - Second Stage Time Pills Missing

## 🐛 Problem
Second stage time pills are not appearing in the carousel, even though the logs show they are generated.

## 🔍 Investigation
The code generates second stage timepoints correctly:
```javascript
result.push({
  time: timeStr,
  isSecondStage: true,
  interval: '15min'
});
```

But they might not be rendering because:
1. `currentIndex` might be positioned incorrectly
2. The pills might be outside the visible range
3. The `isSecondStage` property might not be detected properly

## ✅ Solution Added
Enhanced logging in `renderTimePills()` to debug:

```javascript
console.log(`🔍 Rendering ${allTimepoints.length} timepoints, currentIndex: ${currentIndex}`);
console.log(`📊 Visible timepoints (${startIdx} to ${endIdx}):`, ...);
console.log(`  Pill ${actualIdx}: ${timeStr}, isSecondStage: ${isSecondStage}`);
```

This will show:
- How many total timepoints exist
- Which timepoints are visible in the current view
- Whether second stage pills are detected
- The exact pill being rendered

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

Second stage pills should:
- Be colored green (`.second-stage` class)
- Appear after the first stage ends
- Allow midwives to enter data for 15-minute intervals

## 🚀 Status
Debugging logs added. Please check console for detailed information about second stage pill rendering.
