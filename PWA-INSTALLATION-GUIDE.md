## üîç Troubleshooting

### If the "Install" option doesn't appear:

#### 1. **Check HTTPS Requirement**
   - PWAs require HTTPS (secure connection)
   - Make sure your URL starts with `https://` not `http://`
   - If testing locally, `localhost` is also acceptable

#### 2. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data
   - Safari: Safari menu ‚Üí Clear History

#### 3. **Check Browser Compatibility**
   - **Chrome** (Recommended): Android, Windows, Mac - Full support
   - **Edge**: Windows - Full support
   - **Safari**: iOS only - Limited support
   - **Firefox**: Limited PWA support

#### 4. **Refresh the Page**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - This ensures the latest service worker is loaded

#### 5. **Check Service Worker Registration**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to "Application" tab
   - Check "Service Workers" section
   - Should show "activated and running"

#### 6. **Verify Manifest File**
